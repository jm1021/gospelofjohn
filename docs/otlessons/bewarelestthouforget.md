4. May Stake fireside we had Terryl and Fiona Givens, they spoke of the "The Healing Truths of the Resotration".  Their topics began with our undertanding of God.  A lot of there talk is supplemented by early Chritianity.  These are my notes and correlations from their talk on how I interpreted re-undertanding my relationship with God ...
    * [Origen of Alexandria (c. 185 – c. 253)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origen), also known as Origen Adamantius. Origen taught that, before the creation of the material universe, God had created the souls of all the intelligent beings. These souls, at first fully devoted to God, fell away from him and were given physical bodies. ... my interpretation, the First Estate
        * Additional notes from Fireside: God character, perfection, and attributes accoring to Origen, more generous than we can imagine.
    * [Irenaeus (/ɪrɪˈneɪəs/ c. 130 – c. 202 AD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irenaeus) "Christ came not only for those who believed from the time of Tiberius Caesar, nor did the Father provide only for those who are now, but for absolutely all men from the beginning, who, according to their ability, feared and loved God and lived justly. . . and desired to see Christ and to hear His voice." ... my interpretation, everyone will be taught Jesus Christ
        * Additional notes from Fireside: Co-existent with God, God is collaborative.  Moses 7 Enoch and God the Father.  God is weeping, seeing my children suffer.  This is the reformation God
        * Macrina The advance of the soul is through God's love
        * Julian of Norwich God and Frienship
    * [Universalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universalism), the Eastern versus Western Faith divisions ... In Christian theology, universal reconciliation (also called universal salvation, Christian universalism, or in context simply universalism) is the doctrine that all sinful and alienated human souls—because of divine love and mercy—will ultimately be reconciled to God ... my interpretation, the Infinite Atonement
        * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarnation_(Christianity)">The Incarnation</a> and Resurection of Christ were they keys of early Christianity.
