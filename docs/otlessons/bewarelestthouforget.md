## Moses: Beware Lest Thou Forget the Lord
My experience with reading Deuteronomy was one were the Ancients, those at the time of shortly after the resurection of Jesus Christ, and the modern Church and Propeht were completely unified.  In a period were I see so much crisis, I see that with God we can prevail, just as the Children of Israel.

[Love the Lord: Deuteronomy 6:5-7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/6?lang=eng&id=5-7#p3), [Open thine hand wide: Deuteronomy 15:7-8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/15?lang=eng&id=7-8#p6)

May 15, 2022 by our Prophet, "There is nothing happening on this earth more important than gathering Israel for Him. Let your Heavenly Father know that you want to help. Ask Him to put you to work in this glorious cause. And then stand back and marvel at what happens when you let God prevail in your life."


### Warm-Up activity, as individuals, pairs, or trios review scriptures and thoughs on "How to Love the Lord"
Ponder how to establish a loving relationship with God. What comes when we establish a relationship with God?

4. May Stake fireside we had Terryl and Fiona Givens, they spoke of the "The Healing Truths of the Resotration".  Their topics began with our undertanding of God.  A lot of there talk is supplemented by early Chritianity.  These are my notes and correlations from their talk on how I interpreted re-undertanding my relationship with God ...
    * [Origen of Alexandria (c. 185 – c. 253)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origen), also known as Origen Adamantius. Origen taught that, before the creation of the material universe, God had created the souls of all the intelligent beings. These souls, at first fully devoted to God, fell away from him and were given physical bodies. ... my interpretation, the First Estate
        * Additional notes: God character, perfection, and attributes accoring to Origen, more generous than we can imagine.
    * [Irenaeus (/ɪrɪˈneɪəs/ c. 130 – c. 202 AD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irenaeus) "Christ came not only for those who believed from the time of Tiberius Caesar, nor did the Father provide only for those who are now, but for absolutely all men from the beginning, who, according to their ability, feared and loved God and lived justly. . . and desired to see Christ and to hear His voice." ... my interpretation, everyone will be taught Jesus Christ
        * Additional notes: Co-existent with God, God is collaborative.  [Moses 7:29](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/7?lang=eng&id=29#p27) Enoch ask how can God weep.  God is weeping, seeing his children suffer.  This is a reformation of how we view God, merciful and kind.  [Macrina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrina_the_Younger) The advance of the soul is through God's love. [Julian of Norwich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revelations_of_Divine_Love) And I was answered in my understanding: 'It lasts and ever shall, for God loves it; and so everything has its beginning by the love of God.' In this little thing I saw three properties; the first is that God made it; the second is that God loves it; and the third is that God keeps it.
    * [Universalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universalism), the Eastern versus Western Faith divisions ... In Christian theology, universal reconciliation (also called universal salvation, Christian universalism, or in context simply universalism) is the doctrine that all sinful and alienated human souls—because of divine love and mercy—will ultimately be reconciled to God ... my interpretation, the Infinite Atonement
        * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarnation_(Christianity)">The Incarnation</a> and Resurection of Christ were they keys of early Christianity. Edward Beecher,Satan is trying to destroy true nature of God and the Plan.
5. President Nelson [Choices for Eternity](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/broadcasts/worldwide-devotional-for-young-adults/2022/05/12nelson?lang=eng) 
   * First, know the truth about who you are.  If Lord were to speak to you today... He would make sure you understand is your true identity.  I am simply saying that no identifier should displace, replace, or take priority over these three enduring designations: “child of God,” “child of the covenant,” and “disciple of Jesus Christ.”
   * Second, know the truth about what Heavenly Father and His Son have offered you....  In short, They have offered you everything!  God knows all and sees all. In all of eternity, no one will ever know you or care about you more than He does. No one will ever be closer to you than He is. You can pour out your heart to Him and trust Him to send the Holy Ghost and angels to care for you.  Jesus Christ is the only enduring source of hope, peace, and joy for you.
   * And third, know the truth related to your conversion.  The truth is that you must own your own conversion. No one else can do it for you.  Do you want to experience the sweet, soothing power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ working in your life?  Engage in daily, earnest, humble prayer. Nourish yourself in the words of ancient and modern prophets.  As you make your testimony your highest priority, watch for miracles to happen in your life.  You will have the strength to have a positive influence far beyond your natural capacity. And I promise that your future will be more exhilarating than anything you can presently believe.
