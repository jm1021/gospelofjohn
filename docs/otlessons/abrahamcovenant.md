    * Ishmael, who was 13 when Isaac was born, is considered the founder of Ishmaelites in Islam.  He is the son of Abraham and Hagar. Ishmael is considered the ancestor of Muhammad.
    * Isaac is the only son of Abraham and Sarah who were 100 years and 90 years respectively.   Isaac was the father of Esau and Jacob (Israel).  Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are referred to collectively as the patriarchs of Judaism.
