```
Oh My Father

In thy holy habitation,
Did my spirit once reside?
In my first primeval childhood
Was I nurtured near thy side?
...
Tells me I’ve a mother there.
...
When I leave this frail existence,
When I lay this mortal by,
Father, Mother, may I meet you
...
Let me come and dwell with you.
```


### Thoughts from our Day
* What are some good things you have found as read the scriptures on the creation?
* Peter Bybee spoke of "science being a religion last week", something that is ever changing.  
    * Do you think about how old the earth is?  [National Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/article/how-did-scientists-calculate-age-earth/)
    * Do you think about how old humanity is?  [Wikipedia Mitochondrial Eve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_Eve)
    * Moses lived in 13th to 15th century BCE.  Books of Moses are thought to be transcribed 6th century BCE, same a time Lehi left Jerusalem.
* What do the scriptures say about time and genelogy? 
    * The New Testament provides two accounts of the genealogy of Jesus, one in the Gospel of Matthew and another in the Gospel of Luke.[1] Matthew starts with Abraham, while Luke begins with Adam. The lists are identical between Abraham and David, but differ radically from that point. Matthew has twenty-seven generations from David to Joseph, whereas Luke has forty-two, with almost no overlap between the names on the two lists.⁠ Notably, the two accounts also disagree on who Joseph's father was: Matthew says he was Jacob, while Luke says he was Heli.  These books are attributed to being transcribed about 80-120 AD.  According to geneologies many biblical pursist say Adam is 6000-10000 years old.
    * 2 Peter 3:8 ... one day is with the Lord as a thousand years ...
    * Book of Abraham speaks to time periods versus days ... And it came to pass that it was from evening until morning they called night; and it came to pass that it was from morning until evening that they called day; and they numbered the a sixth time. ...
    * There are four accounts in our scriptures [All 4 accounts, including temple](https://abn.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1986/01/four-accounts-of-the-creation?lang=eng&adobe_mc_ref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.churchofjesuschrist.org%2Fstudy%2Fensign%2F1986%2F01%2Ffour-accounts-of-the-creation%3Flang%3Deng&adobe_mc_sdid=SDID%3D2966C9A2BF731193-23273073DDBBB7D8%7CMCORGID%3D66C5485451E56AAE0A490D45%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1642272237).


### Revelation continues, Restoration continues
#### Everyone will always be left to grapple between Wisdom of the World versus Wisdom of God. But the Gospel and Faith enable us to obtain continuous and pertinant revelation, even enlightnement if we study and ask.  Here are things that are truths that help me continue in Faith as well as enjoy Science ...
* Abraham account says ... "“We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell.”
* Adam is Michael, who helped Jehovah in the Creation. Elder Joseph Fielding Smith wrote: “Adam helped to form this earth. He labored with our Savior Jesus Christ. I have a strong … conviction that there were others also who assisted them. Perhaps Noah and Enoch; and why not Joseph Smith, and those who were appointed to be rulers before the earth was formed?” (Doctrines of Salvation, 1:75.)
* Each of us comes into the world as a unique spirit with a capacity for becoming what our Creator is, in whose image we are formed.
* Brigham Young taught that no revelation is ever received in its fulness.
* In the Book of Ether, the Brother of Jared saw similar visions of the history of man ... And when the Lord had said these words, he showed unto the brother of Jared all the inhabitants of the earth which had been, and also all that would be; and he withheld them not from his sight, even unto the ends of the earth ... Write these things and seal them up; and I will show them in mine own due time unto the children of men.
