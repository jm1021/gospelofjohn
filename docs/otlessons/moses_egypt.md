## Moses: Egypt and The Exodus

### The Plagues of Egypt
This story parallels many of the troubling events in our world today.  Often logic, power, and glories of God do not stop man from carrying on according to what they perceive as comfortable.  Pharoah was obviously enamored with having the children of Israel work for them.  How is Pharoah different from us?

### Possible Plagues of Today
Is it possible that Cars running on fosile fuels could cause be a similar series of catacalismic events.  Will we or the powers that rule be able to turn away from things that seem comfortable.  Is God and the Prophets telling us to change?

### Parallels of Moses in today's society
We just listened to our prophet.  Many of us have opportunity to be like the children of Israel, we are being directed to follow the Lord.

1. Missionaries proclaim, [There is Peace](https://youtu.be/x0kki9l02KM)
2. Prophet declares, [The Power of Spiritual Momentum](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2022/04/47nelson?lang=eng)
    * Get on the covenant path and stay there, "Ordinances and covenants give us access to godly power."
    * Discover the joy of daily repentance, "Walking the covenant path, coupled with daily repentance, fuels positive spiritual momentum", "... the covenant path does not mean that life will be easy"
    * Learn about God and how He works, "... let God prevail in your life", "Moses provided an example of how to discern between God and Satan."
    * Seek and expect miracles, "He parted the Red Sea for Moses", "...realizing the Lord is helping you to move a mountain in your life."
    * End conflict in your personal life, today is the day to "seek and end to personal conflict that has weighed you down"
