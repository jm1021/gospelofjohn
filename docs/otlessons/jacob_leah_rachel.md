### Children Race
Full of all kinds of interesting activities and trials from our times.  Here it seems there is a competition between Leah (Unloved) and Rachel (Loved).  Jacob seeemingly involved in Polygamy -- A Favorite Wife, Slavery -- Maid Servants as wives, and Jealousy.   Rachel is suffering with infertiltiy, not unlike Sarah.  Also, to increase fertility the bring "mandrakes" (fertility drug).

### The Savior can help us overcome discord in our families.
After Joseph is born, Jacob asked to be freed from Laban.  Joseph goes through a phase of negotiation with Laban and does a lot of genetic engineering with the flocks to establish order in each house.  Thought, it seems that Jacob does a lot to improve his personal herds [Genesis 30:42](https://abn.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/30.42?lang=eng#p41).
