### Fearful
* Think of fearful events in sharing your faith in Jesus Christ.  Thoughts from Jörg Klebingat ...
    * Messengers of God who teach “inconvenient” truths are often dismissed.
    * “evil [would be called] good, and good evil”
    * “crowds cannot make right what God has declared to be wrong.”
* Let us therefore respectfully demonstrate that it is not only possible but essential to love a child of God who embraces beliefs different from our own.


### Faithful
* Think of faithful envents in demonstrating your faith in Jesus Christ.  Thoughts from Jörg Klebingat ...
    * "It’s a good day to be good!"
    * "Let us be confident, not apologetic, valiant, not timid, faithful, not fearful as we hold up the Lord’s light in these last days"
    * "Let us demonstrate our love for the Lord through wholehearted, voluntary obedience."
    * "If we really want to be valiant disciples of Christ, we will find a way."
    * “Those who choose the Lord’s way will likely endure persecution.”
    * “Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them.”
* “True disciples of Jesus Christ,” President Nelson taught, “are willing to stand out, speak up, and be different from the people of the world. They are undaunted, devoted, and courageous.”
