1. Think of a current challenge, think as Joseph Smith thought **O God were art thou**.  Read as individual or pair ...
    * [Doctrine and Covenants 121:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.1?lang=eng#p0)
    * [Doctrine and Covenants 121:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.7?lang=eng#p6)
    * Be prepared to answer, what do I expect in adversity?
    * [Doctrine and Covenants 121:45-46](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.1?lang=eng#:~:text=45%20Let%20thy,forever%20and%20ever.)
1. As we rely on Jesus Christ ... do we believe [all that is unfair in life can be made right through Jesus Christ](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2021/10/46cook?lang=eng#:~:text=All%20that%20is%20unfair%20about%20life%20can%20be%20made%20right%20through%20the%20Atonement%20of%20Jesus%20Christ.%E2%80%9D)
    * Quentin Cook comments on the [lack of civility](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2021/10/46cook?lang=eng#:~:text=In%20my%20lifetime%2C%20I%20have%20never%20seen%20a%20greater%20lack%20of%20civility.%20We%20are%20bombarded%20with%20angry%2C%20contentious%20language%20and%20provocative%2C%20devastating%20actions%20that%20destroy%20peace%20and%20tranquility.)
    * What is an example of how you make right the **lack of civility** through **the atonement of Jesus Christ**?
    * What power do you use to **withstand the moment**?
