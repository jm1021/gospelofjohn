1. Think of a current challenge, think as Joseph Smith thought **O God were art thou**, then read ... [Doctrine and Covenants](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121?lang=eng)
2. As we rely on Jesus Christ ... all that is unfair in life can be made right through Jesus Christ.
