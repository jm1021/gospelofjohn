1. Think of a current challenge, think as Joseph Smith thought **O God were art thou**.  Read as individual or pair ...
    * [Doctrine and Covenants 121:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.1?lang=eng#p0)
    * [Doctrine and Covenants 121:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.7?lang=eng#p6)
    * Be prepared to answer, what do I expect in adversity?
1. As we rely on Jesus Christ ... all that is unfair in life can be made right through Jesus Christ.
